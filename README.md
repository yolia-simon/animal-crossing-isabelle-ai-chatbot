# Isabelle Ai Chatbot for Productivity 🌸~

A simple full-stack chatbot inspired by Animal Crossing's Isabelle, built with Vue.js for the frontend and Node.js + Express for the backend. The chatbot currently uses OpenAI’s GPT API for generating responses, but will be changed to a free alternative. Additionally, it includes a small task manager as a demo of frontend interactivity. Later developments will include a playlist section which can play a selection of Animal Crossing themes. Will deploy using Cloudflare and also add account creation so that the user chat history is unique to each person.
